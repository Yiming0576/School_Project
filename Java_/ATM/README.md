# ATM System

### Personal Project as a beginner of Java

## Description

The ATM System is a simple Java application that simulates the operations of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It allows users to sign in, sign up, check account information, deposit money, withdraw money, transfer money to other accounts, change their password, and close their account. The system is designed to manage user accounts, maintain account balances, and enforce security measures such as password protection and daily withdrawal limits.

## Features

- **Sign in:** Users can log in to their accounts using their card number and password.
- **Sign up:** New users can create an account by providing their name, password, and desired daily withdrawal limit.
- **Check Account Information:** Users can view their account details, including their card number, account holder name, balance, and daily withdrawal limit.
- **Deposit Money:** Users can deposit money into their account by specifying the amount they wish to deposit.
- **Withdraw Money:** Users can withdraw money from their account, subject to their available balance and the daily withdrawal limit.
- **Transfer Money:** Users can transfer money from their account to another account by specifying the recipient's card number and the transfer amount.
- **Change Password:** Users can change their account password for added security.
- **Close Account:** Users can close their account, provided their account balance is zero.

## Usage

1. **Signing In:**

   - Users must first sign in using their card number and password.
   - If the user does not have an account, they can sign up to create one.
2. **Account Operations:**

   - After signing in, users can perform various account operations such as depositing money, withdrawing money, transferring money, checking their account balance, changing their password, and closing their account.
3. **Security Measures:**

   - The system enforces security measures such as password protection and daily withdrawal limits to ensure the safety of user accounts.
